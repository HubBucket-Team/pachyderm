# Manage Organizations

!!! note
    Organizations are only available in Pachyderm Hub Pro accounts.

An organization is a collection of users that are associated with
the same entity, such as a company, and belong to the same billing
profile. When you sign up for a paid account, you are prompted to
create an organization.
The first paid user authorized with Pachyderm Hub gets Admin permissions
and can invite new members. In an organization, you can create multiple
workspaces and have a more granular control over resources and members.

To create an organization, sign up for a Pro account as described
below.

## Create a Pro Account

A Pro account on Pachyderm Hub enables you to use more Pachyderm Hub
resources and create more entities, such as workspaces. For example,
in a free account, you can only use your workspace for four hours, after
which all your data, pipelines, and lineage are completely erased.
While a free account lets you try some of the basic Pachyderm functionality,
it cannot be used for an enterprise-level workflow long-term.

Read more about the types of Pachyderm Hub accounts in [Types of Accounts](TBA).

To create a Pro account, complete the following steps:

1. Go to the [Upgrade Account](TBA) page.
1. Click **Upgrade to Pro**.
1. In the upgrade page, type your name and the name of your organization.
1. On the next screen, enter your billing information.
1. On the last screen, add email addresses of the individuals to whom you
want to give access to your Pachyderm Hub organization.

   All members of your team will have Admin access to all workspaces. They
   will be able to create, access, and delete all workspaces, as well as
   member.

   You should receive an email confirmation with an invitation to join
   the Pachyderm Hub organization that you have just created.
